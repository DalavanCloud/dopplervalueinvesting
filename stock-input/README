This is the directory for the input financial data.

For each stock, the input file is originally created in LibreOffice and saved as a *.ods version and *.csv version.
Data is entered in the *.ods file, which has more readable formatting.  
The *.csv file is for the script to process.

The format of the input financial data files:
*  Column 1: name of the line items
*  Column 2: the specific category that the line item of Column 1 fits under
*  Row 1: the year, with the most recent year first
*  Row 2: split factor
*  Row 3: units of the financial data for all "plus" line items
*  Row 4: units of the financial data for all "minus" line items (only necessary if minority interest is a factor)
*  All other rows and columns contain the financial data of a given line item and year
